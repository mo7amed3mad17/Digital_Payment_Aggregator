This project focuses on creating a simplified digital payment aggregator application that allows users to manage and track their financial transactions between individuals. The application aggregates details from various bank accounts and virtual wallets, enabling users to view all their financial information in one place.

This app focusing on peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, where users can be both senders and receivers of funds. The app will simulate money transfers between users and will provide an easy-to-use interface for managing their accounts and transaction history.

Key Features:

User Account Management: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their personal details.
Bank Accounts Management: Users can add and manage virtual bank accounts or wallets, displaying their balances and account names.
Transaction History: Users can view a list of their past transactions, including sent and received amounts.
Simple and Secure Interface: The app will feature a simple, intuitive interface with basic security features such as authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Technologies Used:

Backend Framework: Flask, SQLAlchemy
Database: SQLite
Security: JWT for user authentication
Frontend (if applicable): HTML/CSS for simple front-end development or Postman for API testing.


This project is designed as a graduation project for a software engineering course and is not intended to integrate with real-world banking APIs at this stage. The goal is to provide a working prototype of a digital payment aggregator, focusing on the basic functionality of managing accounts and simulating peer-to-peer transactions.
